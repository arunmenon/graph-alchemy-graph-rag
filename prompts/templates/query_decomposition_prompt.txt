Analyze the following question about a product taxonomy and decompose it into Neo4j Cypher queries.

QUESTION:
{{question}}

{{schema}}

{{examples}}

Step 1: Identify the key entities and relationships in the question.
Step 2: Look at the provided schema and examples to understand the data structure.
Step 3: Review the common queries and example questions for similar patterns you can adapt.
Step 4: Formulate one or more Cypher queries to retrieve the relevant information.
Step 5: Ensure your queries are efficient and focused on the specific question asked.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Use the actual node labels and relationship types from the schema
- Reference the node examples to understand what properties are available
- Look at the relationship examples to understand how entities connect
- Adapt the examples and common queries where possible instead of creating queries from scratch
- Focus on retrieving only the data needed to answer the question
- Include properties in your query that will be helpful for the final answer

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "query_plan": [
    {
      "purpose": "Description of what this query retrieves",
      "cypher": "The Cypher query"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "thought_process": "Explanation of your reasoning and how these queries will help answer the question"
