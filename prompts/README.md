# Graph RAG Prompts

This directory contains prompt files used by the Graph RAG system.

You should copy the following files from the original `prompts/graph_rag/` directory:

- query_decomposition_system_prompt.txt
- query_decomposition_prompt.txt
- reasoning_system_prompt.txt
- reasoning_prompt.txt

These files are essential for the operation of the Graph RAG agents.
