The Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is an advanced knowledge base solution that combines the power of graph databases with state-of-the-art language models to provide accurate, contextually relevant answers to natural language questions. By leveraging Neo4j's graph capabilities and sophisticated semantic reasoning, the system enables users to query complex data structures using plain language, with results that are both comprehensive and explainable.

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of five core components:

1. **Query Processing Layer**
   - Takes natural language questions as input
   - Uses schema knowledge to decompose questions into precise query components
   - Generates optimized Cypher queries for the Neo4j database

2. **Graph Retrieval Layer**
   - Validates and optimizes queries for execution
   - Connects to the Neo4j database to fetch information
   - Implements hybrid retrieval combining traditional queries with semantic search

3. **Semantic Search Module**
   - Enhances retrieval with vector embeddings for fuzzy entity matching
   - Implements tiered approach to embedding generation for optimal performance
   - Provides hybrid search capabilities that combine text and vector-based approaches

4. **Reasoning Layer**
   - Assembles retrieved information into coherent context
   - Applies language model reasoning to generate answers
   - Produces structured responses with evidence and confidence scores

5. **Schema-Aware Example Generation**
   - Analyzes database schema to identify key patterns and relationships
   - Generates domain-specific examples for improved query generation
   - Continuously refines examples based on usage patterns

## Core Workflow Details

### 1. Schema Loading and Management

The schema loading process is central to the system's ability to understand and navigate the graph database:

1. **Schema Loading**
   - The `Neo4jSchemaLoader` class connects to Neo4j to extract schema information
   - Schema extraction includes node labels, relationship types, and their properties
   - Relationship patterns (source-relationship-target) are identified and cached
   - Node counts are collected to prioritize high-value entity types

2. **Schema Formatting**
   - Raw schema data is transformed into human-readable format for prompts
   - Node types with properties and counts are clearly organized
   - Relationship types with their properties are documented
   - Relationship patterns showing connections between node types are presented

3. **Schema Caching**
   - Schema information is cached to improve performance
   - Force refresh mechanism allows updating when the database structure changes
   - Error handling ensures graceful degradation if the database is unavailable

**Code Flow Example:**
```python
# SchemaManager initializes and coordinates schema loading
schema_manager = SchemaManager()

# Schema is loaded from Neo4j and formatted
schema = schema_manager.get_formatted_schema()

# Schema is used for query generation and example creation
examples = schema_manager.get_examples()
```

### 2. Example Generation for Schema-Aware RAG

The system employs a sophisticated approach to generating examples that are schema-aware:

1. **Pattern Identification**
   - The `PatternExampleGenerator` analyzes the schema to identify key relationship patterns
   - Patterns are prioritized based on connectivity and relevance to common queries
   - The system focuses on relationships that are likely to be queried frequently

2. **Context Building**
   - For each pattern, the system assembles relevant context about node types and relationships
   - Property information is collected to provide rich context for example generation
   - Sample entities from the database are identified to create realistic examples

3. **Example Generation**
   - A language model is prompted to generate natural language questions with corresponding Cypher queries
   - Examples reflect real-world usage patterns based on the actual database schema
   - Generated examples include explanations of how the queries address the questions

**Pattern Example:**
```
Given relationship pattern: (Table)-[:HAS_COLUMN]->(Column)

Generated Example:
Question: "What columns are in the Work Order table?"
Cypher: "MATCH (t:Table {name: 'Work Order'})-[:HAS_COLUMN]->(c:Column) RETURN c.name, c.data_type"
```

### 3. Query Processing Flow

The query processing flow transforms natural language questions into precise database queries:

1. **Query Analysis and Decomposition**
   - The `QueryDecompositionAgent` receives a natural language question
   - Using the schema and examples, it analyzes the question to identify entities, relationships, and constraints
   - Complex questions are broken down into multiple sub-queries for comprehensive retrieval

2. **Schema-Aware Query Generation**
   - The agent uses the formatted schema to understand available data structures
   - Example queries guide the generation of appropriate Cypher patterns
   - Generated queries target specific relationship patterns identified in the schema

3. **Query Validation and Planning**
   - Generated Cypher queries are validated for syntactic correctness
   - A query plan is created, organizing multiple queries with their respective purposes
   - The system captures the thought process for transparency and debugging

**Example Query Decomposition:**
```
Input Question: "What work orders are assigned to technicians with electrical certification?"

Decomposed into:
1. Find technicians with electrical certification
   MATCH (t:Technician)-[:HAS_CERTIFICATION]->(c:Certification {type: 'Electrical'}) RETURN t

2. Find work orders assigned to these technicians
   MATCH (wo:WorkOrder)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(t:Technician)
   WHERE t.id IN $technicianIds
   RETURN wo
```

### 4. Graph Retrieval and Semantic Search

The graph retrieval process combines traditional query execution with semantic search capabilities:

1. **Cypher Query Execution**
   - The `GraphRetrieverAgent` validates and optimizes each query in the plan
   - Queries are executed against the Neo4j database
   - Results are processed and formatted for downstream reasoning

2. **Semantic Entity Search**
   - In parallel with direct queries, semantic search is performed using the original question
   - Entity embeddings are compared with the query embedding to find semantic matches
   - The system implements a hybrid approach combining text and vector searches

3. **Result Integration**
   - Results from direct queries and semantic search are combined
   - Semantic search results enhance traditional query results with contextually relevant entities
   - Duplicate results are filtered to provide a clean, consolidated set of information

**Key Implementation Features:**
- **Tiered Embedding Strategy**: Entities are classified into priority tiers, with most important entities embedded first
- **Hybrid Search Algorithm**: Combines traditional text-based search with vector similarity search
- **Progressive Enhancement**: System continues to improve as more entities are embedded

### 5. Reasoning Process

The reasoning process transforms retrieved information into comprehensive answers:

1. **Context Assembly**
   - The `ReasoningAgent` assembles all retrieved information into a coherent context
   - Direct query results and semantic search results are formatted for reasoning
   - Special handling is applied to semantic search results to highlight their semantic relevance

2. **Evidence-Based Reasoning**
   - Language models analyze the assembled context against the original question
   - Step-by-step reasoning is applied to derive accurate answers
   - Evidence from the graph database is cited to support conclusions

3. **Structured Answer Generation**
   - Answers are generated with varying confidence levels based on evidence strength
   - Reasoning steps are captured for transparency and explainability
   - Results include supporting evidence and confidence scores

**Example Reasoning Output:**
```json
{
  "answer": "There are 5 work orders assigned to technicians with electrical certification, specifically WO-1034, WO-1089, WO-1156, WO-1203, and WO-1345.",
  "reasoning": "I first identified technicians with electrical certification, finding 7 technicians. Then I checked which work orders were assigned to these technicians, resulting in 5 matches.",
  "evidence": [
    "Technician Alex Wong has Electrical Certification",
    "Work Order WO-1034 is assigned to Alex Wong",
    "Technician Sarah Chen has Electrical Certification",
    "Work Orders WO-1089 and WO-1156 are assigned to Sarah Chen",
    "..."
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

## Agentic Flow Coordination

The entire system is orchestrated through a flexible `WorkflowManager` that coordinates the agent pipeline:

1. **Agent Registration**
   - Agents are registered with the workflow manager in a specific execution order
   - Each agent has a well-defined purpose and interface for integration

2. **Pipeline Execution**
   - The manager executes agents sequentially, passing data from one to the next
   - Each agent processes input and produces structured output for the next stage
   - Execution timing and performance metrics are tracked

3. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Robust error handling ensures graceful degradation
   - If one agent fails, the system can still provide partial results
   - Error information is propagated to subsequent agents

**Typical Workflow Setup:**
```python
# Create workflow manager
workflow = WorkflowManager("graph_rag")

# Add agents to the pipeline
workflow.add_agent(QueryDecompositionAgent())
workflow.add_agent(GraphRetrieverAgent(enable_semantic_search=True))
workflow.add_agent(ReasoningAgent())

# Execute the workflow
result = workflow.run_pipeline({"question": user_question})
```
