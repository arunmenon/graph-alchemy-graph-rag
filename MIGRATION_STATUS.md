# Graph RAG Migration Status

## Completed

- [x] Created standalone graph_rag package structure
- [x] Added essential infrastructure files:
  - [x] setup.py
  - [x] requirements.txt
  - [x] README.md
  - [x] .gitignore
- [x] Copied over essential agent base classes:
  - [x] agent_base.py
  - [x] workflow_manager.py
- [x] Updated configuration to use new paths
- [x] Created migration guidance documents
- [x] Added utility scripts for migration:
  - [x] check_migration.py
  - [x] cleanup_original.py

## Still Needed

- [ ] Copy prompt files from prompts/graph_rag/ to graph_rag/prompts/
- [ ] Resolve dependencies on graph_db module
- [ ] Fix imports in all agent files to use relative imports
- [ ] Create a proper prompts directory with all required prompt files
- [ ] Update API endpoints to work with standalone package
- [ ] Test the standalone package thoroughly
- [ ] Update external scripts to use new module

## Testing

To validate that the migration is working:

1. Run `python check_migration.py` to see what files are still missing
2. Once all issues are resolved, test with examples
3. Only then use the cleanup_original.py to clean up the original files

## Next Steps

1. Address any imports that reference agentic_workflow package
2. Copy prompt files from original location
3. Add more examples to demonstrate how to use the package
4. Ensure good documentation throughout the codebase

## External Dependencies

Be aware of these external dependencies:

1. Neo4j database connection 
2. Any OpenAI or other LLM provider keys
3. Schema cache expects a valid database connection
4. Prompts for each agent
